                    When I first saw the introduction mini-tasks I wanted to make a website that could make a pretty good summary of myself. I wanted it to be similiar to a project I did when I was younger, which was 
                    also and introduction website. I also wanted it to be more interesting though, so I thought of making a webgame. However, procrastination is indeed a cruel mistress, and I ended up only having 
                    2 days to work on it. At first, I still wanted to do sort of a game, so I was working through the logistics of it.

                    Luckily, one of my friends talked me out of it. He was a very wise man who knew all too well about the pain of making your scope too big. So, I decided to just make a poster. <br/><br/>
                    I was on a time limit, with only two hours left, so I thought to myself, what's an easy poster to make that would still tell them enough about me? I settled on replicating a tumblr profile.

                    As you can see, it's not exactly super accurate. I couldn't be super meticulous with the details as I would have liked, but the energy is still there. I like to think that I did a good job with it.

            <h1> Nibble </h1>
            <div id="nibble" class="section">
                <p> 
                    I really appreciated my Nibble during this application process. A blockmate and I decided to join together since we knew each other from being grouped together during the DCS Bootcamp earlier that year. 
                    We looked for a suitable upper year pair to go with us, and we actually looked for one of our ates during that bootcamp. They were already taken though, so we looked for a pair that would align with our
                    interests. So, we found Kuya Ethan and Ate S.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    When we were going to meet them for the first time, I was honestly super nervous. My Nibblemate and I were both freshman, while they were both fifth-years. There was a clear experience gap between us, but
                    luckily, they were really nice and understanding. I sort of interrogated them that first day about CS in UPD, and we barely talked about our mini-tasks. The food was good though. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We eventually met online to actually complete our mini-tasks, where we played some personality games to try to figure out which Mean Girl we were. We honestly probably misunderstood the instructions, but
                    who cares? We were having fun.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Emman and I ended up cramming the output together. We found a good template and set to work, using the one picture that we took during our first meeting with them. It was a lot of work, copy-pasting all of
                    the letters all the time. I still really enjoyed it though, I don't usually work in that style. 
                </p>

            <h1> DTP </h1>
            <div id="dtp" class="section"> 
                <p> 
                    I was pretty excited for the DTP. After all, the reason I wanted to apply in the first place was to gain experience. A training program was already one step closer to my goal. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Yeah I crammed a lot of the outputs, but to be honest, I just wanted to make a website myself. I lost interest for a while when we were simply just answering GForms, but when we started actually applying 
                    the Javascript we were learning, I had a lot of fun.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h1> SigSheet </h1>
            <div id="sigsheet" class="section">
                <p> 
                    The SigSheet was sort of stressful to me. I don't really like seeking people out, especially if I don't know where to look for them. I simply attended the tambay sessions whenever I could, not only to get
                    the stickers for the SigSheet, but also to try to maybe catch more people. I think I didn't try hard enough though, and I also think it was a big blow that I wasn't able to attend one of the major events 
                    due to a scheduling conflict with one of my GEs. I might've been able to get a lot more signatures from there if I had attended. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Still though, being able to meet the other applicants and ask about the various aspects of both UP and CSI life from the mems was a very valuable information source for me. 
                </p>

            <h1> Internship </h1>
            <div id="internship" class="section"> 
                <p> 
                    For internship, I was really excited about it, but I ended up pushing it back really far because I have lots of doubts with myself. All in all though, I think I had fun studying how to make a website like 
                    CSI does and learning a little bit more about svelte.
