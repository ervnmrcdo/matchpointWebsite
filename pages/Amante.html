                In the first task we were told to Introduce ourselves in our own creative way. After much deliberation
                I decided to reference something fun.
                <br><br>
                This ended up with me referencing Pokemon in a Valorant themed group. <br>Sure...
                <br><br>
                The Pokemon cards above are supposed to represent a brief introduction on my personality, hobbies, likes, and dislikes.
                And yes, that is me sleeping back in highschool sleeping on chairs like they were beds

                <br><br>
                I incorporated various parts of my personality into this explanation lol
                <br><br>
                I'm fairly sleepy oftentimes, sleep schedule is a myth
                <br>
                I like trying out new things, usually no matter what it is regardless of my skill level at it
                <br>
                Finally, I've got nothing but my best

                We also went out to eat for out MiniTask and talked for a pretty long time until we had to go to class
